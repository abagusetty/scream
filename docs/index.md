# Simple Cloud-Resolving E3SM Atmosphere Model (SCREAM)

Some nice introductory text goes here! Maybe some figures, too. Who knows?

* The [User Guide](user/index.md) guide explains how to run SCREAM, both in
  its standalone configuration and within E3SM.
* The [Developer Guide](dev/index.md) guide contains all the information needed
  to contribute to the development of SCREAM.
