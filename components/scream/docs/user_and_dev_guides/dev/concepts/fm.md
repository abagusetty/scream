# Field Manager and Grids Manager

Describe what the FM is. Should not take long, since it's mostly just
a container that also allocates. Biggest task is the allocation of
tracers and the handling of groups/subgroups.

Then describe GridsManager. Even faster than FM.

Should we move these two in field.md and grid.md files? I think so.
